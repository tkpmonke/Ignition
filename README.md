# Ignition
Fast, Lightweight, and easy-to-use general purpose game engine

## Features
nothing for games yet, but the editor has a customizeable grid, can create objects, and thats it (for now)

## Compile From Source
requires the following
- GLEW
- GLFW
- GLM
- Assimp
- 7z (for hub)
- python (for hub)
- stb_image.h (included)
- IMGUI (included)

run `premake5 gmake2 && make -j` for unix-like systems. `-j` adds multithreading to make, if you don't want/have multithreading, remove that<br/><br/>
or<br/><br/>
run `premake5 vs2022` and open the .sln file for windows devices. Windows isn't fully supported yet, don't be surprised if it doesn't work (it doesn't)

## More Info
if your gonna make a game in this engine (when it's ready for real games to be made in it), then please feel free to contact me whenever if you have a question about the engine or would like to suggest a feature to be implemented :D
